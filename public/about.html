<h1>About Me</h1>

Hi,</br>
<p>My name is Mai Yinglin, but you can also call me Vicky. 
I currently live in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but I was born and raised in southern China. 
I graduated from a university in Guangzhou, China, where I majored in Japanese. </p>
<p>Following graduation, I worked at different consulates in Guangzhou as a language instructor. I've been lucky to have been exposed to diverse countries and cultures.
<p></p>In my free time, I love traveling and exploring different cultures. I have lived in four different countries, including Mainland China, United States, Sudan, and Ethiopia. I also speak four languages, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and Japanese. I am always curious about the languages and cultures all around the world. One of my dreams is to travel the world before I turn 60. Iâ€™ve been to 31 countries so far, so I have some way to go. But that also gives me more excuses to travel! </p>
<p>In addition to traveling, I'm passionate about video editing. It's the perfect skill for today's social media-driven world, where videos reign supreme in capturing attention. I even put my editing skills to the test by creating and editing a Halloween short film entirely on my own two years ago!</p>
